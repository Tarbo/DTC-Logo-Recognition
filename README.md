# Project Description

## **Logo IDing**: ***Sifting Through Pixels for Brand Identification***


#### Project Summary

This is a project I did as an Insight Data Science Fellow from May to mid-July, 2020 at the Toronto location. The aim of the project is to use computer vision to identify the brand of a probduct in an online image of the product. The three key components are the *object detector (Yolov4)*, *feature extractor (NasNetLarge)*, and the *similarity measure (cosine similarity) for brand matching*.
